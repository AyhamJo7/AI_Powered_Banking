- **Smart Login and Authentication**
  - Multi-factor authentication
  - Facial recognition
  - Keystroke dynamics analysis
  - Location verification
  - Device fingerprinting

- **Intelligent Transaction Processing**
  - Real-time fraud detection
  - Risk-based transaction approval
  - Anomaly detection in spending patterns
  - Automatic flagging of suspicious transactions

- **Proactive Defense System**
  - Continuous security monitoring
  - Threat intelligence integration
  - Self-healing capabilities
  - Zero Trust Architecture implementation
  - Honeypot/Honeytoken deployment

- **AI-Powered Security**
  - Machine learning models for behavior analysis
  - Continuous learning from new threats
  - Adaptive security measures
  - Predictive risk assessment

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/banking-system.git
   cd banking-system
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Run the main application to see a demonstration of the system's capabilities:

```
python main.py
```

This will:
1. Set up demo user accounts
2. Simulate legitimate and suspicious login attempts
3. Process financial transactions with risk assessment
4. Run a security scan
5. Demonstrate the proactive defense system

# Log in to the system
```
python cli.py login --username angel_abubakar
```

# Transfer money between accounts
```
python cli.py transfer --sender 1001 --receiver 1002 --amount 100
```
# Run a security scan
```
python cli.py scan
```

# Run tests
```
python run_tests.py
```


## Class Diagram

The system is built around the following core classes:

- **Customer**: Represents a bank customer with authentication data
- **LoginInterface**: Handles user login interactions
- **AuthenticationSystem**: Manages the authentication process
- **AIEngine**: Provides AI capabilities for security analysis
- **UserDatabase**: Stores and retrieves user data
- **ProactiveDefenseSystem**: Detects and responds to security threats
- **Transaction**: Represents financial transactions

## Security Features

- **Zero Trust Architecture**: No implicit trust, continuous verification
- **Adaptive Multi-Factor Authentication**: Dynamic security based on risk level
- **Self-Healing Systems**: Automatic response to detected threats
- **AI-driven Encryption Management**: Intelligent key management
- **Honeytokens & Honeypots**: Traps to detect and analyze attack patterns

## Development

This project is currently a demonstration of the concept. For production use, consider:

1. Implementing proper database storage (PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
2. Adding a web interface with Flask or Django
3. Deploying actual machine learning models for the AI components
4. Implementing proper encryption using libraries like cryptography
5. Adding comprehensive logging and monitoring
